=head1 NAME

Git::Archive - For automated file archiving with Git

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Git::Archive;
  Git::Archive->commit({ msg => "Committing files", files => [qw/foo bar/] });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When you want to have code maintain a file archive by committing changes to a Git repo,
you don't have the luxury of being lazy and simply telling the code to do:

  git pull
  git commit changes
  git push

Many little things can go wrong:

=over

=item What if files are already staged when your code goes to commit its changes?

=item What if there are conflicts on pull?

=item What if the world ends?

=back

This is a module that helps you not have to care about such questions!
(Two out of three ain't bad)

The goal is to allow you to simply call the commit method, and know that you'll get
a useful error and safe recovery to a working state, whatever goes wrong.

=head2 Arguments:

=head3 msg

Commit message. This one is mandatory.

=head3 files

List of filenames to commit. Necessary unless you specify all_tracked or all_dirty.
Can be a string if only one filename is to be committed, otherwise should be
an arrayref of filename strings.

=head3 error

Default behaviour for errors is to just dump them to STDERR.

If you want something more exciting (like email!) supply a subref here.

=head4 Args:

=over

=item $args

Hashref, mostly the arguments you passed in when calling the commit method

=item $error

String containing the actual error message

=back

=head3 success

If you want to execute some code upon successful commit supply the function here

=head4 Args:

=over

=item $args

Hashref, mostly the arguments you passed in when calling the commit method

=back

=head3 all_tracked

If you want to simply commit all tracked files, set this to be true

=head3 all_dirty

If you want to commit all changes in the directory, tracked or not, set this to be true

=head3 use_remote

If you want to push to a remote, set this to the name of the remote
(You'll typically want this to be 'origin')

=head3 check_all_staged

If you want to make sure every file supplied in the 'files' arg is staged before committing,
set this to be true: It will then throw an error if the file was unchanged/doesn't exist

=head3 git_dir

If you want to use a directory other than the current one as your repo, specify it here

Note: If your git-controlled dir is ./foo and you want to commit the file ./foo/bar/baz
then ( git_dir => './foo', files => 'bar/baz' )
